#Task 1: Code Correction You are provided with a Python script that is supposed to help in event planning, but it has errors. Identify and fix them.

attendees = int(input("Enter number of attendees: "))
venue = "large hall" 
print ("large hall") if attendees > 100 else print("conference room")

#Task 2: Venue Selection: Based on the code from Task 1, further enhance your code to recommend additional things like "audio system" or "projector" based on the number of attendees.






#Task 3: Catering Choices: Ask the user if they want "vegetarian" food. Recommend "Veggie Delight Caterers" if yes, otherwise recommend "Gourmet Meals Caterers".

vegetarian = input("Would you like vegetarian food? yes/no: ")

print("We recommend Veggie Delight Caterers!") if vegetarian else print("We recoomend Gourmet Meals Caterers!")
